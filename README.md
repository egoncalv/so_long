This project is a small 2D game.

Its purpose is to make you work with textures, sprites, and some other basic gameplay elements.

For this project we are going to use the school graphical library: the MiniLibX. This library was developed internally and includes basic necessary tools to open a window, create images and deal with keyboard and mouse events.

I have learned how to manage windows, images, keyboard events, as well as pathfinding algorithms and graphical programming.
